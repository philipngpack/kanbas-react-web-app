Implement the grades screen in public/Kanbas/Courses/Grades/screen.html by combining the content
 of the Kanbas Navigation, Course Navigation and Grade so that it renders as shown in Figure 3.2.1.
  Use a table with three columns and copy the Kanbas Navigation into the 1st column, 
  the Course Navigation into the 2nd column,
   and the Grades into the last column.
    Users can navigate to the grades screen by clicking Courses on the Kanbas Navigation sidebar in the first column below.
     Then they click on Grades on the Course Navigation sidebar in the second column.
      Use HTML tables to layout the columns as shown. Use HTML lists and anchors to render the navigation links as shown.
       The grades screen renders in the third column below.
       Feel free to make up your own users/students, assignments, and grades.
       You only need 4 students and 4 assignments.
       Some of the grades must be input fields as shown.
       Use select element to render the Gradebook and Export dropdowns below.
       Don't worry about options not shown.
       Make sure the Student Names and Assignment Names input fields have the placeholder shown.
       The buttons Import, Configure, and Apply Filters, don't need to work yet.
       Only the links Account, Profile, Courses, Home, Assignments, and Grades need to work.
       Configure other links with href="#" for now, since we don't yet care where they navigate to. 
     Confirm you can navigate between Home and Grades.
