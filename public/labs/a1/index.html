    <h1>HTML Examples</h1>
    <h2>Heading Tags</h2>

    <p>
        This is the first paragraph. The paragraph tag is used to format vertical gaps between long pieces of text like
        this one.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the second paragraph. Even though there is a deliberate white gap between the paragraph above and this
        paragraph, by default browsers render them as one contiguous piece of text as shown here on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the third paragraph. Wrap each paragraph with the paragraph tag to tell browsers to render the gaps.
    </p>
